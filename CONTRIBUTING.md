# Contributing

This is a repository primarily for the 2017 Mozilla Fellows, who are all collaborators on this repo, and can use it to share resources, update their fellowship resumes/experience records and triage requests from our broader community.

Please note we have a code of conduct; please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

All fellows are encouraged to fork this repository and make contributions to their directory (`name/`) throughout their fellowship tenure.

At the end of their fellowship, fellows will be asked to submit a pull request to merge their changes with the master repo. This should have minimal conflicts if no changes were made outside of the fellows' own directory.

If there are any complications or questions about this, feel free to contact aurelia@mozillafoundation.org.

## Issue Process

Issues are designed to provide a space where community members and Mozilla staff can request contributions or involvement from the fellows. 

* An `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` file will pre-populate a standard form for any issue created
* Aurelia and Ann Marie will triage and label these issues upon submission
* Aurelia and Ann Marie will tag fellows for whom that issue is relevant and further promote the issue in Slack
* Conversation on issue processing and fulfillment will continue until the issue can be closed.
