# Code of Conduct

Mozilla projects and events are community-driven, intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning.

We value the participation of every member of our community and want all contributors/patrons to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all folks are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout any in-person activities and in interactions online associated with Mozilla.

To make clear what is expected: everyone taking part in a project - including fellows, instructors, helpers, organizers, and learners â€” is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Mozilla Staff will enforce this code throughout events, but you may also contact us directly by email at aurelia@mozillafoundation.org. All communication will be treated as confidential.

## The Short Version

Mozilla is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants/contributors.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
* Participants/contributors/patrons violating these rules may be asked to leave any in-person event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a refund of any charge that may have been levied. Likewise, if online contributors exhibit similar behavior they will be asked to terminate contribution.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

## The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of contributions or events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event/repository/community with no refund of any fee that may have been levied.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at aurelia@mozillafoundation.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers or contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
